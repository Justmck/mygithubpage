                                            <p>This challenge is a series of design challenges in the user interface space, asking those who take it on to create UI elements independent of any additional planning. 5 days a week, Monday-Friday, participants are emailed a prompt and must complete it by the end of the day. The point of the challenge is to become a better UI designer through tons of practice. It's a <a href="https://dailyui.co/">challenge I highly reccommend</a>, and after looking into it I decided to start at the beginning of the new year albeit with a few changes, primarily being that I would only spend an hour per project. Being a full-time student is quite time consuming on it's own, and each prompt as easy as it might seem could easily take me an entire day. So, I decided put a time constraint for myself to not only practice interface design techniques, but also rapid ideation and prototyping during a time crunch.</p>

                                        <h2>Why I Decided to do it</h2>
								            <p>This challenge has been met with it's fair share of criticism. It has been said that the "solutions" to the prompts addressed aren't real solutions, and are just pretty pixels without any thought put into them, and that this challenge contributes to a phenomenon called the <a href="https://medium.com/intercom-inside/the-dribbblisation-of-design-406422ccb026#.7pwp4a8it">dribbblisation of design.</a> I disagree. I believe that the challenge lets participants explore different visual styles and experiment with ideas that while not necessarily useful, can help contribute to projects in the future. Design is about communicating ideas, and if you can practice the skills needed to convey those ideas, then practicing is what you should do. So while my Daily UI "shots" aren't sometimes realistic, I've added them to my portfolio as a way to show off my expanding visual UI design talent and expand my techniques so that when a larger, substantial project comes around, I'll be better prepared for it.</p>

Subtle magenta-blue gradient at a 45degree angle as the user works down the page, entering information into the fields. I wanted to create a mobile optimized TypeForm experience, with extra features such as tapping the top arrow to return to the top of the form. Something I really appreciate about TypeForm is its decision to not overload the user with all options at once, and present them one at a time. It makes it much easier to double check you input the correct information if you don’t have 20 input boxes staring you in the face. I was worried about completing this in an hour, but made great time. Exploration period was about 10 minutes, and then I began to execute on it. Pleased with how it turned out overall, I’d give myself a score of 9.5/10.">

Instead of simply doing a credit card form, I decided to show the products in cart on the left hand side of the screen. This choice stems from a personal issue I’ve had where websites have large, beautiful pictures of their products, only to be hidden and confined as mere text links in checkout. My regret with the design is that I left far too much white space in the middle of the checkout screen, partially due to running out of time for more forms. Also, the Apply Pay button seems out of place considering the top label is “visa”. Overall, 7.5/10.">

It seemed appropriate to adapt the film’s evil First Order into an organization focused on recruitment. Also interesting is the content viewpoint I chose for this project. From their standpoint, the First Order isn’t evil: their goal is to bring peace to the galaxy through whatever means necessary. The hero image was essential in making this turn out well, and I think the color contrast of red and white vs. the more traditional red and black helped it stand out more. A relatively generic layout, but nonetheless a pretty good design. I think it’s an 8.5/10.">

						<a href="" data-largesrc="images/dailyuishots/004.jpg" data-title="004 Calculator" data-description="Calculators all basically function the same, so I wanted to change that with this DailyUI shot. The app is expandable, and changes based its screen dimensions. The keypad and operations all act as you would expect, but I added two key features. First, the calculator shows a detailed log of your most recent operations; by clicking on an option in the scrollable feed, you can “undo” all the way back to that point. This is also very helpful when you realize you messed up somewhere, and can quickly find out where you went wrong. The second feature is a large undo operation button, which is something I found many calculators are lacking. I’d argue that this was a great idea, but my execution was lacking in some areas. Due to the time constraints, I couldn’t fully finish the scrollable feed, and there are several UX issues on the smaller version. This is probably a 7.5/10 in my book.">

For the first 35 minutes or so, this app icon was for a company called Citrus which was a food delivery service. However, after not getting the icon how I wanted it, I scrapped the whole thing and moved on to a more concrete, visual design. This sun setting behind rolling hills was originally an ocean, but that too was scrapped. While it turned out to be a decent icon, I am disappointed I couldn’t bring together any of the several other great ideas I had. 7/10 for poor planning on my part, even if the app icon itself came out looking alright.">

As a first go at this style, I think it turned out quite well. The Twitter profile card had good typography colors, and emphasized the right things. The button at the bottom should be an inverted color, but how I made it is still a valid option. The geometric shapes are out of scale and should be about 60-70% of their current size. This is my most colorful and fun shot yet, and I really like how it developed in the hour. I’d give it a 9/10.">

I am incredibly interested in how we can use voice to perform actions a la Amazon Alexa, and I truly believe that the next generation of interfaces will be increasingly using voice as a source of input. Unfortunately, I don’t like at all how this shot turned out visually. The gradient is not nearly as smooth a transition as 001, and the buttons at the bottom don’t really align with what I had envisioned. I will continue use Ava in many of my future shots until I can perfect the voice interface, but this time I’d have to give this a 6/10.">

Pusheen typically has very emotional, adorable faces, so what better way to alleviate some of the frustrations of having a page not found than a cute cat as disappointed as you are? This was a really simple but fun shot to make, and while I think I could have done better placement with the link at the bottom, it still works pretty well. 7.5/10.">

Deciding what to keep and what to get rid of was a challenge, due to the drastically reduced screen space to work with. Album art is an underappreciated visual element in many music apps, and is reduced to either a small square or a title. I wanted to incorporate the album art into the full background of the application to make better use of an amazing piece of art that is available with every song. Basic controls for the song were kept, in addition to a song visualizer a la SoundCloud. I spent a lot of time bouncing around different ideas, but with a few slight modifications this would turn out as a great smart watch optimized music app. I think this deserves an 8/10.">

It’s one of my most used apps, and has helped me found countless restaurants when traveling and at home. So an interesting social share I came up with was location; specifically, one recommended by FourSquare. I stayed with the colors and much of the visual design elements of FourSquare, and created a full page share experience that pulls a background image from either a review you personally left, or from a different reviewer. I really like the balance of this screen, and this is an option I would like the see the actual app utilize more. Instead of simply sharing links to locations, sharing a rich content card would increase impressions and interactions with that restaurant. Because of both real world application and the visual style, I’d give this a 9.5/10 score.

This could be a screen for a diet app, where personalize messages could perhaps motivate the user in a way similar to the Carrot app series (except slightly toned down). I’m incredibly happy with the photos of cake/salad I used, and was surprised to find such a perfect fit for this idea online. While I like the colors for the primary elements, the text colors could be improved for increased readability. In addition, now that I look back I’m not quite sure why I made the points score look like a button. 9/10 for being a fun shot that with another 5 minutes, a few tiny changes could go a long way.

I explored several different options for this shot, all trying to build off of the classic Leica brand. Unfortunately, none of my options panned out and I had to scrap all of my concepts 15 minutes before the deadline. I went with a phot background that I was inspired by some of Nikon’s marketing for, and put together a quick landing page layout (above the fold). I wanted to emphasize and work with the story of the Leica brand, but it turned out that an hour was just not enough time. I’d give this a 7/10 because overall the visuals are realistic and are usable, I think the camera could have been woven into the design of the page a lot better.">

This is a pretty generic design, but I wanted to experiment with transparencies when combined with opaque shapes. The double affordance of a small tab and lit up box to indicate to the user who they were currently talking to was a great addition I made somewhat last minute. The visual differentiation of online vs. offline users is indicated by the blue/red rings around user portraits was also a helpful affordance. Looking back, I think I should have added a GIF option due to the popularity of add-ons like Giphy, as well as making better use of the top space. This was a pretty realistic high-fidelity mockup, and as such I think it’s an 8.5/10.">

I always enjoy watching the SpaceX live streams, and really like the bottom timeline to show when different stages occur. This is more of an imitation of their stream interface than a redesign, but I did create a massive countdown clock as opposed to the smaller one in the corner that they utilize now. My thoughts were that as the time is T-minus 0, post-launch the countdown moves to where SpaceX has it now. I really like this as a concept, and believe SpaceX could turn their launches into more visible debacles for the general public (even though enthusiasts already do) to increase public interest in private spaceflight. I’d rate this a 9/10 for being a great graphic design.">

						<a href="" data-largesrc="images/dailyuishots/015.jpg" data-title="015 On/Off Switch" data-description="With the prompt for today being an on/off switch, I wanted to make something that wasn’t your typical light switch. I have an LED strip in my bed, and while having a remote that controls the color options is great, I also have a third party button connected to my outlet to turn it on/off. The lack of an ability to control the colors from this button consistently frustrates me, because then I have to go find the remote to change any settings. So I began experimenting with an on switch that gives a way to control colors. Pushing the button reveals the on or off states, but with the on state the button lights up and a colorful ring appears. Moving the slider around the ring changes the color (as expected), but a late addition I added at the last minute was instead of having a white or neutral color slider, having the slider be the color that is currently selected leads to a better user experience. I wish I could have experimented with this as a physical object as opposed to an app interface element, but nonetheless I learned a few new radial gradient tips; I’d personally rate this 8/10.">

My initial goal was to not only design a mockup, but create an animated gif using Flinto. Unfortunately, I ran out of time for the gif but the intention was an animated weather icon, and a pulsating alert icon. The background behind the icon also changes based on the time of day and weather: with a quick glance, the user not even reading the text can tell it is night and snowing. I’d rate this a 7/10 because I wish I had gotten to the animated gif and not following all Android Wear guidelines, but I can’t wait to experiment more with the moto360 screen in the future. Round smart watches open up a lot of different interactive and visual elements not currently available on hardware such as the Apple Watch.">

When I incorporate a brand into my shots, keeping with the story and feel of the brand is always a top priority. DJI has positioned itself as the high tech but consumer-friendly leading drone company, and I wanted to pick up on the Apple-esque feel of their products. Similar to my DailyUI shot 002 where I want to show a receipt with a large picture of the actual product you bought; not just a text-based link. I really like that I was able to fit all of the information I wanted to on the bottom third of the page, but still not inflict information overload on the user. Typically, the top interaction with an email receipt such as this is to track your order and on expensive purchases like this drone that is particularly important. This fact is reflected in the large blue “Track your Order” button, which is also optimized for mobile usage when viewing the email receipt on your phone. The email receipt is something I think needs a complete overhaul, and this is a great start. I’d rate this a 9.5/10">

On this day, the markets were substantially down, so I drew inspiration from that for this idea. I modeled this chart off of the popular iPad stock app Stocktouch, which has been a favorite of mine for years. A global view of the stock market in a particular sector is difficult to visualize unless it’s an index like the NASDAQ, but Stocktouch made it easy by color coding each particular stock, and sorting them by industry into a grid. I’m disappointed I ran out of time to give valid data to each individual stock, and the highlighted “AAPL” stock doesn’t accurately portray the touch interactions I was hoping for. Great idea but poor execution on my part, deserving a 7/10.">

Taking a look online at one one of the many different statistics on football teams was the QB rating, so I decided to make a leaderboard based on that because it would give me the opportunity to experiment with photographs of people; something I had not done much of thus far. While I typically make photos fade in the background, I wanted these players to be front and center of the leaderboard. Having an arm outside the frame gives it an extra sense of dimension, and was a fun style I had not tried before. Also, my fear of team colored background that didn’t contrast with text luckily was not an issue. This shot isn’t as much a UI as it is a collection of visual elements, but nonetheless I rate it 8.5/10 because with a few scale changes it would make a great mobile leaderboard.">

The color palette was one of my primary concerns, because I wanted to emulate the enjoyable childhood experience of getting ice cream through my app screen. I like much of the palette I chose, and especially the tiles of different ice cream types. However, the beige color scheme introduced too many different levels of saturation and the background and map began to blend together visually. The ice cream / candy “theme” centered around an old-timey pastel color palette is one I will definitely be trying again in the future, but for now I think this was a decent start; probably deserving of 7.5/10.">

There are so many different directions one could go with this prompt, and home automation is something I am really fascinated in as one of the few areas where screen interactions have not yet become standardized. This being said, I feel underwhelmed with what I ended up producing. While the navigation at the top is a good start to sorting the information, how I laid out this home screen doesn’t make a lot of sense looking back at my work. The home chat log with my AI assistant Ava shouldn’t have such a large emphasis, and there is a lack of standardization of how tiles are titled. The centerpiece of this shot was the “resume dinner” function: this was where a homeowner could leave the house for a bit, and the house would automatically “pause” all cooking appliances while they were out to prevent both accidental fires and overcooked food. Once they came back, they would tell Ava to resume cooking dinner. This was a great concept, but I think was executed in a slightly confusing manner. I’d give this challenge a 7/10.">

As the IoT, smart wear, and other devices that aren’t phones begin to weave themselves into our daily lives, we need to prepare to interact with objects that don’t necessarily have screens. This being said, I created a text console of a voice interaction with Ava where the user asks a question not with their phone, but through a smart watch or other worn sensor. This dialog is not accessed through that watch but through a phone or tablet because chat dialog can become quite lengthy. Reviewing this dialog is totally optional, but provides the user with a way to edit or gain more information about a particular request (represented by the underlined hot links to critical speech identified by Ava). I’m a big fan of the concept, and I’d say this is a 9/10 score for being a very clean visual representation of how Ava and the user talk back and forth with natural speech.">

This shot is a few screens of the onboarding for a delivery app that provides emphasis on getting your package to its destination safely and securely. Playing with a script font was a fun change from my typical sans serif mix, and definitely gave these screens the handcrafted, personal care feeling I was going for. The pastel red-yellow-blue combo provided a calm transition between pages, as well as emphasize different topics within this “informational” onboarding. Overall, I’d give this a 9/10 for being a successful deviation from the styles I typically use, and for getting its goals across to the user.">

						<a href="" data-largesrc="images/dailyuishots/024.jpg" data-title="024 Boarding Pass" data-description="Another of my prompts thus far, I knew immediately that I wanted to create a smart watch interface for a ticket. I decided to accomplish this is a minimized passbook style, following both the Apple Watch design guidelines and introducing a few of my own. A boarding pass at its core fulfills two purposes; it provides information about the flight, and provides a way of validating that you should be allowed on said flight. For this reason, I focused on creating two different elements in this pass. The first was consolidating all of the information a passenger might need about their flight; gate, location, time, and more. I also decided to prioritize “time until boarding” as the most critical piece of information, seen at the top of the pass because that is often the first and most frequent question one asks while at the airport. The second element I focused on was the “view boarding pass” button, which follows Apple guidelines as a large tappable button. This opens up a full screen QR code that can be quickly scanned at the terminal, as well as being a screen indicating NFC pass verification is active. I was rather underwhelmed by the visual styling of Delta’s current Apple Watch offering, and would love for them to bring something similar to this to their app as well. This was one of my favorite shots yet, deserving a 9/5/10 in my opinion. ">

						<a href="" data-largesrc="images/dailyuishots/025.jpg" data-title="025 TV App" data-description="The reason for this challenge being a bit over my one-hour goal was due to looking for the Netflix style TV show tiles, without which this design looked incredibly bare. I spent a good third of my time trying to get a comparable Gaussian blur to the Apple TV interface, but was ultimately unsuccessful. After pitching a quick question to a few friends, I realized that for an online TV guide channel selection isn’t nearly as important as browsing the content itself. “Netflix live” is a strange concept I envision where channels and content providers broadcast their content to a central interface (in this case Netflix) to try to win back the audience they have lost due to the influx of cord-cutters. The idea that internet TV could replace traditional TV is almost laughable at this point in time, but as live sporting events begin streaming online (some of the last holdouts to putting their content content are live events) it could become a possibility in the future. With a massive subscriber base, who better than Netflix to carry the torch for live online TV? I’d give myself an 8/10 on this design because while it does portray my idea accurately, many of the visual elements are subpar. Definitely a topic I look forward to working on in the future.">
